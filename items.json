Haavk Corp claimed he drowned during the escape, but after his jailbreak, there have been multiple sightings of him around the world—though every time Haavk investigators go after the clues, they return empty-handed.",

    "15080050158_Description": "Prisoners respectfully call him Mr. Loud, a famous painter from Ahsarah, middle-aged male. He was an artistic genius, once full of passion and dreams, hoping his paintings could go from Ahsarah to the world. Early in his career, his works were mostly brightly colored plein air oil paintings, but after Haavk's arrival in Ahsarah, his artistic style changed. He began using low-saturation colors extensively and incorporating more critical elements into his paintings. To express his dissatisfaction with Haavk's interference in Ahsarah's internal affairs, he held an exhibition in Brakkesh that drew crowds. The extensive symbolism and subtle satire in his works angered Haavk, who arrested the painter on charges of \"inciting public disorder\" and \"spreading reactionary ideas\" to make an example for Ahsarah's cultural community. Imprisoned in Tide Prison, the painter gradually became silent and withdrawn, increasingly despondent.",

So he sent his son to the New Tower of Babel, hoping his son would recover under Haavk's care. But what he didn't know was that Haavk had actually selected his son as a test subject for neural device experiments, and his son died during the process. He tried to expose Haavk's actions to the media, but got no results. In his anger, he began attempting to attack Haavk employees and was eventually arrested and imprisoned. After struggling helplessly, he realized that opposing Haavk was futile. He also suffered mental and physical torture in prison, his hair quickly turned white, and he despaired of this world. The prisoners all call him the Whitehead.",

He knows full well he's gambling with his life this time, often muttering under his breath \"next time I'll be the house.\" Hidden in the corner of his cell are probability formulas he wrote. The last page roughly calculates: if he detonates the hydraulic cooling pipes during a firefight between G.T.I. and the Guards, causing a three-way battle, the death rate would be 93.6%, while his own chance of escaping in the chaos... The numbers have been repeatedly crossed out and rewritten, finally ending with just a drawing of a grinning dice.",

He was once one of Ahsarah's tribal leaders, holding high position and power, and extremely despised former king Diwan's behavior of flattering the invaders. To drive Haavk forces out of Ahsarah and make it an independent, autonomous nation again, he chose to cooperate with the Ahsarah Guard. As Yousef's ally, he successfully helped overthrow former king Diwan's rule. When he began envisioning Ahsarah's return to freedom under the Ahsarah Guard's leadership, a Haavk Corp raid shattered his dreams. To cover Yousef and other Guard leaders' retreat, he deliberately exposed his position to attract Haavk security forces' attention and was eventually captured. Haavk subjected him to severe torture and interrogation, using every means possible, but he still refused to reveal core Ahsarah Guard intelligence. What he doesn't know is that after his imprisonment, Yousef tasted power and transformed into a tyrant, and the Ahsarah Guard has long since become a loose alliance due to internal strife.",
